## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- A simple app that introduces myself through labels.
- Adds interactivity by allowing users to change the background color to keep the experience engaging.
- Potential future improvements: animated color transitions, customizable text, and background themes.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:
- Understanding and setting up Auto Layout constraints programmatically.
- Ensuring random colors are not too light or too dark to maintain text readability.
- Handling Swift syntax and UIKit behaviors without using Storyboard heavily.
